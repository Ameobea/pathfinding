This crate implements several pathfinding, flow, and graph algorithms in [Rust][Rust]

- [A*][A*]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [breadth-first search (BFS)][BFS]: explore nearest neighbours first, then widen the search.
- [depth-first search (DFS)][DFS]: explore a graph by going as far as possible, then backtrack.
- [Dijkstra][Dijkstra]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- [Edmonds Karp][Edmonds Karp]: find the maximum flow in a directed graph.
- [Fringe][Fringe]: find the shortest path in a weighted graph using an heuristic to guide the process.
- [IDA*][IDA*]: explore longer and longer paths in a weighted graph at the cost of multiple similar examinations.
- [Kuhn-Munkres][Kuhn-Munkres]: find the maximum (or minimum) matching in a weighted bipartite graph.
- [Topological sorting][Topological sorting]: find an acceptable topological order in a directed graph.

Those algorithms are generic over their arguments.

## Using this crate

In your `Cargo.toml`, put:

``` ini
[dependencies]
pathfinding = "0.6"
```

You can then pull your preferred algorithm (BFS in this example) using:

``` rust
extern crate pathfinding;

use pathfinding::bfs;
```

## Example

We will search the shortest path on a chess board to go from (1, 1) to (4, 6) doing only knight
moves.

``` rust
use pathfinding::bfs;

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, Hash, Ord, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
struct Pos(i32, i32);

impl Pos {
  fn neighbours(&self) -> Vec<Pos> {
    let &Pos(x, y) = self;
    vec![Pos(x+1,y+2), Pos(x+1,y-2), Pos(x-1,y+2), Pos(x-1,y-2),
         Pos(x+2,y+1), Pos(x+2,y-1), Pos(x-2,y+1), Pos(x-2,y-1)]
  }
}

static GOAL: Pos = Pos(4, 6);
let result = bfs(&Pos(1, 1), |p| p.neighbours(), |p| *p == GOAL);
assert_eq!(result.expect("no path found").len(), 5);
```
