/// Compute a shortest path using the [breadth-first search
/// algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).
///
/// The shortest path starting from `start` up to a node for which `success` returns `true` is
/// computed and returned in a `Some`. If no path can be found, `None`
/// is returned instead.
///
/// - `start` is the starting node.
/// - `neighbours` returns a list of neighbours for a given node.
/// - `success` checks whether the goal has been reached. It is not a node as some problems require
/// a dynamic solution instead of a fixed node.
///
/// A node will never be included twice in the path as determined by the `Eq` relationship.
///
/// The returned path comprises both the start and end node.
///
/// # Example
///
/// We will search the shortest path on a chess board to go from (1, 1) to (4, 6) doing only knight
/// moves.
///
